#A Contest Driven Meta Online Judge

CD-MOJ is a meta online judge, where the main objective is to submit users
codes to another online judge, in order to take advantage of the current
infrastructure available.

Our main goal is to create a simple submission system where teachers can set
contests, or exercise lists, to their students and follow how students are
evolving in an Algorithm class.

Also we use a simple system to detect software plagiarism.

Besides the idea of creating a simple system for professors, we aim to
create an API to deploy an decentralized infrastructure to judge problems
online.

The idea is to create trustworthy peers to judge problems, in order to avoid
outages of some judge sites. Besides, anyone could set it own instance of
CD-MOJ and could benefit of this model and also to contribute with a judging
machine.

We look forward some students to create and set this distributed model of
judging problems.

##Code

CD-MOJ is entirely written in Bash script, server and html side. It is easy
to maintain and easy to create plugins.
